Developing a Language Processing Pipeline for Micro-Haskell
The objective of this practical is to illustrate the language processing pipeline in the
case of a small but interesting fragment of the Haskell programming language.The practical illustrates all stages of the language processing pipeline for programming languages, taking us from a source file, written in MH, to execution of the program.
In this case, the pipeline has four stages: lexing, parsing, typechecking and evaluation.
